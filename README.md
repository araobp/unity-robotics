## Unity Simulation

Currently, the Unity simulation implementation is in its early stages.

## Robot Scene in Unity

Work on the robot scene in Unity has recently begun.

## Robot Scene in Godot (Discontinued)

Initially, Godot was considered for this project. However, due to its limitations in 3D capabilities, development was shifted to Unity. While Godot is a preferred engine for many use cases, it was not suitable for the 3D requirements of this simulation.
