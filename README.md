# AI Robot Simulation with Gemini Robotics

(Work in progress)

## Robot 3D model made with Blender

The original blend file is in https://github.com/araobp/blender-3d/tree/main/robots

=> [YouTube video (rendered Blender's Cycles rendering engine](https://youtu.be/C_qCqOBFJzs)

## Simulation on Unity

(Just started implementing it)

=> [Code](./robotics)

=> [Gemini.cs](/robotics/Assets/Scripts/Gemini.cs) This is a Gemini-generated C# port of [my original GDScript code for Gemini API](https://github.com/araobp/airport/blob/main/airport/scripts/gemini.gd).

Gemini API:
- [Speech Generation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/speech-generation)

## Robot scene on Unity

I have just started working on the robot on Unity.

## Robot scene on Godot

First I tried to use Godot but gave up using Godot for its 3D capabilties are weak. I like Godot but not for a project like this.
