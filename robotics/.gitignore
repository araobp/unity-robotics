# This .gitignore file should be placed at the root of your Unity project folder.
#
# Unity generated files
# =====================
# The 'Library' folder contains automatically generated files by Unity. These files can be safely ignored as Unity will regenerate them when needed [4].
# The 'Temp' folder is used for temporary files during builds and other operations.
# The 'Obj' folder is used for intermediate object files during compilation.
# The 'Build' folder is for builds of your project.
# The 'Logs' folder contains Unity editor logs.
# The 'MemoryCaptures' folder can contain very large files [3, 6].
# The 'AssetBundles' folder is for asset bundles created by Unity.
# The 'Assets/AssetStoreTools' folder is for Unity Asset Store tools.
# The 'Packages/manifest.json' and 'Packages/manifest.lock' are important for package management, but some generated files within 'Packages' can be ignored.
# The 'ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt' is often ignored to avoid conflicts when upgrading Unity versions.
